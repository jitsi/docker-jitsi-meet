# Install guide for kubernetes

This guide will deploy jitsi in the most simple way: as several containers in a single pod. This is enough to start in case your hardware is enough. If you need to scale components to severa instance, you'll have to modify it to use several services and pods.

Create a namespace to deploy jitsi to:

`kubectl create namespace jitsi`

Add the secret with secret values (replace `...` with some random strings):

`kubectl create secret generic jitsi-config -n jitsi --from-literal=JICOFO_COMPONENT_SECRET=... --from-literal=JICOFO_AUTH_PASSWORD=... --from-literal=JVB_AUTH_PASSWORD=... `

Deploy the service to listen for JVB UDP traffic on all cluster nodes port 30300:

`kubectl create -f jvb-service.yaml`

Now we can deploy the rest of the application. First modify the `DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS` env value in deployment.yaml to point to one of nodes in your cluster (or load-balancer for all nodes if you have one), and then deploy it:

`kubectl create -f deployment.yaml`

To expose the webapp, we can use Ingress (replace the `host` value with your actual hostname):

`kubectl create -f web-service.yaml`

You can either use "https" or "http" service port, depending on whether your ingress allows self-signed certs.
