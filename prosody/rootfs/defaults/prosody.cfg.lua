-- Prosody Example Configuration File
--
-- Information on configuring Prosody can be found on our
-- website at http://prosody.im/doc/configure
--
-- Tip: You can check that the syntax of this file is correct
-- when you have finished by running: luac -p prosody.cfg.lua
-- If there are any errors, it will let you know what and where
-- they are, otherwise it will keep quiet.
--
-- The only thing left to do is rename this file to remove the .dist ending, and fill in the
-- blanks. Good luck, and happy Jabbering!


---------- Server-wide settings ----------
-- Settings in this section apply to the whole server and are the default settings
-- for any virtual hosts

-- This is a (by default, empty) list of accounts that are admins
-- for the server. Note that you must create the accounts separately
-- (see http://prosody.im/doc/creating_accounts for info)
-- Example: admins = { "user1@example.com", "user2@example.net" }
admins = { }

-- Enable use of libevent for better performance under high load
-- For more information see: http://prosody.im/doc/libevent
--use_libevent = true;

-- This is the list of modules Prosody will load on startup.
-- It looks for mod_modulename.lua in the plugins folder, so make sure that exists too.
-- Documentation on modules can be found at: http://prosody.im/doc/modules
modules_enabled = {

	-- Generally required
		"roster"; -- Allow users to have a roster. Recommended ;)
		"saslauth"; -- Authentication for clients and servers. Recommended if you want to log in.
		"tls"; -- Add support for secure TLS on c2s/s2s connections
		"dialback"; -- s2s dialback support
		"disco"; -- Service discovery

	-- Not essential, but recommended
		"private"; -- Private XML storage (for room bookmarks, etc.)
		"vcard"; -- Allow users to set vCards

	-- These are commented by default as they have a performance impact
		--"privacy"; -- Support privacy lists
		--"compression"; -- Stream compression (Debian: requires lua-zlib module to work)

	-- Nice to have
		"version"; -- Replies to server version requests
		"uptime"; -- Report how long server has been running
		"time"; -- Let others know the time here on this server
		"ping"; -- Replies to XMPP pings with pongs
		"pep"; -- Enables users to publish their mood, activity, playing music and more
		"register"; -- Allow users to register on this server using a client and change passwords

	-- Admin interfaces
		"admin_adhoc"; -- Allows administration via an XMPP client that supports ad-hoc commands
		--"admin_telnet"; -- Opens telnet console interface on localhost port 5582

	-- HTTP modules
		--"bosh"; -- Enable BOSH clients, aka "Jabber over HTTP"
		--"http_files"; -- Serve static files from a directory over HTTP

	-- Other specific functionality
		"posix"; -- POSIX functionality, sends server to background, enables syslog, etc.
		--"groups"; -- Shared roster support
		--"announce"; -- Send announcement to all online users
		--"welcome"; -- Welcome users who register accounts
		--"watchregistrations"; -- Alert admins of registrations
		--"motd"; -- Send a message to users when they log in
		--"legacyauth"; -- Legacy authentication. Only used by some old clients and bots.

-- Force certificate authentication for server-to-server connections?
-- This provides ideal security, but requires servers you communicate

-- For more information see http://prosody.im/doc/s2s#security

-- Select the authentication backend to use. The 'internal' providers
-- use Prosody's configured data storage to store the authentication data.
-- To allow Prosody to offer secure authentication mechanisms to clients, the
-- default provider stores passwords in plaintext. If you do not trust your
-- server please see http://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_auth_internal_hashed
-- for information about using the hashed backend.

-- Select the storage backend to use. By default Prosody uses flat files
-- in its configured data directory, but it also supports more backends
-- through modules. An "sql" backend is included by default, but requires
-- additional dependencies. See http://prosody.im/doc/storage for more info.

--storage = "sql" -- Default is "internal" (Debian: "sql" requires one of the
-- lua-dbi-sqlite3, lua-dbi-mysql or lua-dbi-postgresql packages to work)

-- For the "sql" backend, you can uncomment *one* of the below to configure:
--sql = { driver = "SQLite3", database = "prosody.sqlite" } -- Default. 'database' is the filename.
--sql = { driver = "MySQL", database = "prosody", username = "prosody", password = "secret", host = "localhost" }
--sql = { driver = "PostgreSQL", database = "prosody", username = "prosody", password = "secret", host = "localhost" }

-- Logging configuration
-- For advanced logging see http://prosody.im/doc/logging

--  Logs info and higher to /var/log
--  Logs errors to syslog also
